# ImageProcessing Class
Class Initialization Example:
- directory: Path for the folder containing the images.
- size: Pair of integers specifying the size of each image after resizing and transforming to vector.
- extension: Any valid image extension.
- label: The images class label for supervised learning.
```
image_preprocessing_object = ImagePreprocessing(directory = 'path/',  size = (64, 64), extension = 'jpg', axis = 1, label = 4)
input_to_nn, expected_output = image_preprocessing_object.getVectorizedImages()
```
Functions:
- getVectorizedImages()
> This function returns 2 matrices:
1- A matrix of all the images specified in the directory with the specified extension as a numpy array.
The "axis" parameter specifies whether the returned matrix will have the vectorized images stacked as columns or rows, if "axis = 1" the images will be stacked as column vectors, else the images will be stacked as row vectors.
The output matrix shape will be (number_of_images, size[0] * size[1] * 3) if "axis = 0", and (size[0] * size[1] * 3, number_of_images) if "axis = 1".
2- A column/row vector as specified by the parameter "axis", that is the vector 

# DataManipulation
Class Initialization Example:
- axis: Specifies whether the data matrix will be treated as column vectors or row vectors.
```
data_manipulation_object = DataManipulation(axis = 1)
```
Functions:
- concatinate_arrays(list_of_numpy_arrays)
> This function concatinates multiple arrays as columns.
- shuffle_data(training_set, test_set)
> This function shuffles both arrays in columns with the same permutation to match the training set data with its labels.

### Tech
* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.
```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md] [PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md] [PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)
